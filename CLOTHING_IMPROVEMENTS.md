# ðŸŽ¨ Enhanced ControlNet++ Union SDXL Backend with CLOTHING IMPROVEMENTS

## Key Improvements for Your Kaggle Code

### 1. Enhanced Prompt Engineering with Clothing

Replace your current `get_enhanced_prompts` function with this enhanced version:

```python
def get_enhanced_prompts_with_clothing(prompt: str, negative_prompt: str = "", sketch_type: str = "face", art_style: str = "realistic") -> tuple:
    """
    ENHANCED prompt engineering with proper clothing for full body sketches
    - Strong single subject constraints
    - Proper clothing for full body sketches
    - Style-aware prompt generation
    - Removed conflicting style terms from negative prompt
    - Better anatomical guidance
    """
    
    # Detect gender from prompt for clothing
    prompt_lower = prompt.lower()
    is_male = any(word in prompt_lower for word in ["boy", "man", "male", "guy", "gentleman", "sir"])
    is_female = any(word in prompt_lower for word in ["girl", "woman", "female", "lady", "woman", "miss"])
    
    if sketch_type == "face":
        # Face-optimized prompts with strong single subject constraints
        if art_style == "realistic":
            enhanced_prompt = f"realistic portrait of one person, professional photography, natural skin, detailed features, studio background, sharp focus, beautiful, single face, proper anatomy, {prompt}"
        else:  # cartoon/animation
            enhanced_prompt = f"anime style portrait, stylized features, vibrant colors, single face, clean lines, {prompt}"
        
        # Clean negative prompt without conflicting style terms
        base_negative = "deformed, extra limbs, multiple faces, mutated hands, blurry, out of focus, low quality, glitch, split face, extra heads, extra bodies, anatomical error"
        
    else:  # full_body
        # Full body-optimized prompts with proper clothing
        if art_style == "realistic":
            if is_male:
                clothing = "wearing casual clothing, decent attire, proper shirt and pants, appropriate dress"
            elif is_female:
                clothing = "wearing casual clothing, decent attire, appropriate dress, modest clothing"
            else:
                clothing = "wearing casual clothing, decent attire, appropriate dress"
            
            enhanced_prompt = f"realistic full body portrait of one person, professional photography, natural skin, detailed features, {clothing}, proper anatomy, single figure, natural pose, {prompt}"
        else:  # cartoon/animation
            if is_male:
                clothing = "wearing casual anime clothing, decent attire, stylized outfit"
            elif is_female:
                clothing = "wearing casual anime clothing, decent attire, stylized outfit"
            else:
                clothing = "wearing casual anime clothing, decent attire, stylized outfit"
            
            enhanced_prompt = f"anime style full body portrait, stylized features, vibrant colors, {clothing}, single figure, clean lines, {prompt}"
        
        # Clean negative prompt without conflicting style terms
        base_negative = "deformed, extra limbs, multiple faces, mutated hands, blurry, out of focus, low quality, glitch, split face, extra heads, extra bodies, anatomical error, multiple people, inappropriate clothing, revealing, nude, naked"
    
    # Combine with user's negative prompt if provided
    if negative_prompt:
        final_negative = f"{base_negative}, {negative_prompt}"
    else:
        final_negative = base_negative
    
    return enhanced_prompt, final_negative
```

### 2. Update GenerateRequest Model

Add the `art_style` parameter to your GenerateRequest class:

```python
class GenerateRequest(BaseModel):
    prompt: str
    negative_prompt: str = ""
    image_data: str
    num_inference_steps: int = 30
    control_type: str = "scribble"
    sketch_type: str = "face"  # "face" or "full_body"
    art_style: str = "realistic"  # "realistic" or "cartoon"
    controlnet_conditioning_scale: float = 0.95
    guidance_scale: float = 6.5
```

### 3. Update the Generate Endpoint

In your `/generate` endpoint, replace the prompt generation call:

```python
# OLD:
enhanced_prompt, final_negative = get_enhanced_prompts(
    request.prompt, 
    request.negative_prompt,
    2,  # scribble control type
    request.sketch_type
)

# NEW:
enhanced_prompt, final_negative = get_enhanced_prompts_with_clothing(
    request.prompt, 
    request.negative_prompt,
    request.sketch_type,
    request.art_style
)
```

### 4. Update Parameters Endpoint

Add clothing information to your `/parameters` endpoint:

```python
@app.get("/parameters")
async def get_current_parameters():
    """Get current enhanced parameters"""
    return {
        "default_controlnet_conditioning_scale": 0.95,
        "default_guidance_scale": 6.5,
        "default_num_inference_steps": 30,
        "supported_control_types": ["scribble", "canny"],
        "supported_sketch_types": ["face", "full_body"],
        "supported_art_styles": ["realistic", "cartoon"],
        "model_info": {
            "controlnet": "xinsir/controlnet-union-sdxl-1.0",
            "base_model": "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0",
            "approach": "Enhanced ControlNet++ Union SDXL with CLOTHING IMPROVEMENTS"
        },
        "prompt_examples": {
            "male": ["boy", "handsome boy", "young man", "teenage boy"],
            "female": ["girl", "beautiful girl", "young woman", "lady"],
            "neutral": ["person", "portrait", "character"]
        },
        "clothing_features": {
            "full_body_male": "casual clothing, decent attire, proper shirt and pants",
            "full_body_female": "casual clothing, decent attire, appropriate dress",
            "full_body_neutral": "casual clothing, decent attire, appropriate dress"
        },
        "recommended_parameters": {
            "face_sketch": {
                "controlnet_conditioning_scale": 0.95,
                "guidance_scale": 6.5,
                "num_inference_steps": 30
            },
            "full_body_sketch": {
                "controlnet_conditioning_scale": 1.0,
                "guidance_scale": 7.0,
                "num_inference_steps": 35
            }
        }
    }
```

### 5. Update Test Endpoint

Update your test endpoint to reflect the new features:

```python
@app.get("/test")
async def test_endpoint():
    """Test endpoint"""
    return {
        "message": "Enhanced ControlNet++ Union SDXL Backend with CLOTHING IMPROVEMENTS is working!",
        "status": "success",
        "features": [
            "Enhanced preprocessing (clean control signals)",
            "Strong single subject constraints",
            "Proper clothing for full body sketches",
            "Style-aware prompt generation",
            "Optimized parameters for sketch adherence",
            "Fixed prompt engineering",
            "Memory optimizations"
        ]
    }
```

## Key Benefits

1. **Proper Clothing**: Full body sketches now automatically include appropriate clothing based on gender detection
2. **Decent Attire**: All clothing is described as "decent" and "appropriate" 
3. **Gender-Aware**: Different clothing for male/female/neutral characters
4. **Style-Aware**: Different clothing for realistic vs cartoon styles
5. **Safety**: Negative prompts include terms to prevent inappropriate content

## Usage Examples

- **Male full body**: "boy" â†’ "wearing casual clothing, decent attire, proper shirt and pants"
- **Female full body**: "girl" â†’ "wearing casual clothing, decent attire, appropriate dress"
- **Neutral full body**: "person" â†’ "wearing casual clothing, decent attire, appropriate dress"

## Copy to Your Kaggle Notebook

Replace your current Kaggle code with these improvements. The key changes are:

1. Replace the `get_enhanced_prompts` function with `get_enhanced_prompts_with_clothing`
2. Add `art_style` parameter to your request model
3. Update the generate endpoint to use the new function
4. Update your parameters and test endpoints

This will ensure that full body sketches always have proper, decent clothing! ðŸŽ¨ðŸ‘•
